                <td>Goblin was the first proper character I ever played in a TTRPG. He was a bit flat as I was still getting used to the idea of this type of gaming, and so I mostly just focused on one element of his backstory; the amount of debt he owed for his mech suit. All in all though, this was a really fun game and it got me hooked on this hobbey.</td>
